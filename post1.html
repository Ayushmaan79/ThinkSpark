      <h2>You Are Poor Because You Are Intelligent</h2>
      <p><em>Published on June 25, 2025</em></p><p>This title sounds backward — but let’s dig deeper. Could it be that intelligence, when unmanaged, becomes a hidden obstacle to success?</p>

  <h3>1. Overthinking = Delayed Action</h3>
  <p>Smart people often analyze every detail before making a move. In real life, fast action often beats perfect planning. Overthinking leads to hesitation — and missed chances.</p>

  <h3>2. Playing Safe</h3>
  <p>Intelligent people often avoid failure at all costs. But most rich people failed dozens of times. Playing it safe may keep you comfortable, but not wealthy.</p>

  <h3>3. Knowledge Without Execution</h3>
  <p>Reading, learning, understanding — it feels productive. But without action, it's just passive knowledge. Success loves doers, not just thinkers.</p>

  <h3>4. Intellect vs. Risk</h3>
  <p>Starting a business or investing always carries risk. Intelligence often seeks control and prediction — but real success lives outside your comfort zone.</p>

  <p><strong>So what’s the fix?</strong> Don’t stop being smart — but learn to act even when it's not perfect. Use your brain to move forward, not hold yourself back.</p>

  <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Being intelligent is a gift. But without boldness and execution, that gift stays wrapped forever.</p>
