      <img src="../images/dopamine.jpg" alt="Brain with dopamine signals" class="post-image"><p>Dopamine. You’ve probably heard it called the "pleasure chemical" — but it’s much more than that. It’s the reason you check your phone 100 times a day, chase goals, fall into habits, and feel addicted to likes or gaming.</p>

  <h3>🔬 What is Dopamine?</h3>
  <p>Dopamine is a neurotransmitter — a chemical that transmits signals in the brain. But unlike other brain chemicals, dopamine is mostly about <strong>anticipation</strong> rather than satisfaction.</p>

  <h3>⚙️ How It Drives You Daily</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>📱 Every ping from your phone = dopamine hit</li>
    <li>🍔 Craving junk food? That’s dopamine triggering desire</li>
    <li>🎯 Motivated to finish a project? Yup, that’s dopamine</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>🧠 Why It Matters</h3>
  <p>When dopamine circuits go wrong, it can lead to <em>addictions, depression, or even Parkinson’s disease</em>. When they’re balanced, they help you stay focused, learn, and achieve your goals.</p>

  <h3>💡 Fun Fact</h3>
  <p>The biggest dopamine spikes don’t come from rewards — but from <strong>unexpected rewards</strong>. That’s why surprises feel so good!</p>

  <h3>🧩 Final Thought</h3>
  <p>Understanding how dopamine works gives you power. You can hack your own motivation, break bad habits, and even rewire your brain — just by paying attention to what triggers you.</p>

  <p><em>Now ask yourself: are you doing things because you want to — or because dopamine is pushing you?</em></p>
